#Plasma KDE 6 Desktop scripts
These are some scripts "I" made because I felt these features were missing.
Just "chmod +x" the scripts, and you can either use them in the terminal, or you can add them as shortcuts.
If you dont know how to add them as shortcuts throught the terminal you can add them through the plasma settings.
I dont know if these work with plasma 5 or not, but I imagine they dont.
