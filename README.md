# RotatingDesktop
This script allows someone to go to the next desktop and when having reached the last go back to the first.
Unfortunately this only works in kde plasma. With some changes it may work in other DE but I am to lazy for that.
Requirments: Kde plasma, xdotools. I think thats it.

I think this license allows you to copy and distribute my script but not sell? Just do whatever.
(That is not selling my script, I dont want people to profit off of foss that people have released FOR FREE FOR EVERYONE TO USE!!!)
